# MIMIC3_Extubation_Prediction
We built an AI-based model to predict extubation outcome in ventilated ICU patients. As prolonged ventilatory support increases the risk of medical complications, a decision support tool could help to improve patient health by optimizing the outcome of planned extubations. Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction led to an overall best performance of the XGBoost model, when focusing on minimizing false positives. Length of mechanical ventilation, tracheotomy occurrence and oxygen saturation were the most important features in classifying extubation outcome.
